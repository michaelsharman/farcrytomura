Introduction
-------------------------------

This script imports basic navigation and HTML data from an existing FarCry database into a Mura one.


Requirements
-------------------------------

This was built on

    Railo 3.2+
    ColdFusion 7+
    FarCry 6+
    Mura 5.4+
    MySQL 5+

Not sure about FarCry 5, you should be ok as I don't think the v6 schema changes will effect this script

To make things easier, session management must enabled


Installation
-------------------------------

Probably easiest to put this folder (farcrytomura) in the webroot of an existing project/vhost, then call it from http://www.yourproject.com/farcrytomura/

If you want, you can setup a project/vhost specifically for this, but it's not necessary.

This script has its own Application.cfc to avoid scope conflict

Caveat - the ColdFusion/Railo server (instance/context) that you run this from needs to have BOTH dsn's (the FarCry and Mura ones) in the cf admin


FarCry content types
-------------------------------

Currently we examine the FarCry navigation tree and bring across the entire structure underneath 'Root' (i.e. any nLevel 2+ nodes)

If people want it, we can extend the functionality to import from a specific node, e.g. from 'Home'. This would be handy if your FarCry site has secondary/utility navigation etc that you want imported separately.

Although all navigation nodes will be created in Mura, the only actual content that is imported is dmHTML, we ignore:

    dmInclude
    dmLink
    Anything but the first content object under a navigation node
    dmNews, dmEvent or any other "dynamic" content type
    Custom tree content types

Basically we import all navigation nodes under the site tab, from "Root" down, including the HTML content.


FarCry homepage content
-------------------------------

Currently we ignore the farcry homepage content because we assume there is at least a "home" page in Mura. This is a TODO


SES URLs
-------------------------------

Mura ses url's are created on import based off the title of the page from FarCry. This should be the default behaviour as if you were created a page from within Mura admin.

Currently we're NOT importing the FarCry friendly URL into Mura.


Rolling back
-------------------------------

If you want to rollback the import, you'll need to:

DELETE FROM tcontent WHERE siteID = '[yoursite]' AND lastUpdateBy = 'farcrytomura'


TODOs
-------------------------------

    Ability to select the page template from Mura
    When previewing the Mura navigation tree, indent properly
    Import the FarCry "home" page content
    Handle farcry secondary/utility nav's (anything else at the same level as "home")
    Fix sortorder on sub items, they work fine but not as neat as they could be
